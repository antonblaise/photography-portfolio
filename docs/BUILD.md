# Project Milestones

Frontend: Next.js with Tailwind CSS

Host: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

Backend and Database: [Supabase](https://supabase.com)

Media Storage: [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com)

Version Control: [GitHub](https://github.com)

Language: TypeScript

GitHub project backlog: https://github.com/users/antonblaise/projects/1

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

### Remote and Local Repositories

Create GitHub repository for project.

Create Next.js project locally.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest .
```

Use these settings:

```plaintext
√ Would you like to use the recommended Next.js defaults? » No, customize settings
√ Would you like to use TypeScript? ... Yes
√ Which linter would you like to use? » ESLint
√ Would you like to use React Compiler? ... Yes
√ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... Yes
√ Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? ... Yes
√ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... Yes
√ Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? ... No
√ Would you like to include AGENTS.md to guide coding agents to write up-to-date Next.js code? ... No
```

Initialise the local git repository and link it to its remote GitHub counterpart.

Push all the changes.

Sign up for Vercel, Supabase and Cloudinary.

## Phase 2: Design Database and Link to App

Link GitHub project to Vercel and deploy it.

Upload photos to Cloudinary. Organise and sort in folders for easy browsing.

### Create Database

Create data tables on Supabase:

* cameras
  * id
  * name
  * format
* film_stocks
  * id
  * name
  * iso
* photos
  * id
  * title
  * image_url
  * camera_id
  * film_stock_id
  * is_digital
  * date

Add rows in the `camera` and `film_stocks` tables, and then the `photos` table, which relates to the previous two, to populate the database. Use photo URLs from Cloudinary.

Go to `Authentication` > `Policies`, and enable read access for all users for all 3 tables.

### Connect Supabase to Vercel

* On Supabase, go to `Project Overview`, copy the `Project URL`.
* On Vercel, go to `Environment Variables`, add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, and paste the Supabase Project URL in.
* On Supabase, go to `Settings` > `API Keys` > `Legacy anon, service_role API keys`, copy the `anon` `public`.
* On Vercel, add another Environment Variable - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and paste the API key in.

For local repository, create a file named `.env.local` in the root folder, and paste these in:

```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<Project URL>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<API Key>
```

Make sure `.env.local` is ignored by Git (`.gitignore`).

## Phase 3: Build APIs and Main Page

Now we work on the git repository.

Install `supabase` using `npm`.

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

### Create Supabase Client

Create a folder named `utils`. Inside it, create a `.ts `file named `supabase.ts`.

Import 'create client' from supabase module.

Read Supabase  from `.env.local` and store them in constants.

Create a Supabase client using those environment variables, store it in another constant, and export it.

### Create Actions Hub

In `utils` folder, create another `.ts` file named `actions.ts`. 

For all the actions that the webpage does, they'll be defined in this file. For example, pulling data from Supabase, filtering, sorting, viewing, searching, calculating, etc.

First, create a type named `Photos` to specify the type of each column's data from the Supabase `photos` table. Then, create and export an asynchronous function to get photos into an array.

### Allow Cloudinary in Next

In `next.config.ts`, add a configuration to whitelist (allow) Cloudinary server to load our images from there into this Next app.

### Homework

1. Change the browser tab title of the webpage.
2. Change the browser tab icon of the webpage.
